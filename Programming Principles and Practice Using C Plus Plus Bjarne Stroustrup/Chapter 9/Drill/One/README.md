# Drill 1
This drill simply involves getting the sequence of versions of
**Date** to work. For each version define a **Date** called
**today** initialized of June 25, 1978. Then, define a **Date**
called **tomorrow** and give it a value by copying **today**
into it and increasing its day by one using **add_day()**.
Finally, output **today** and **tomorrow** using a << defined in 9.8.

Your check for a valid date may be very simple. However, don't accept a month that is not in the [1,12] range or day of the month that is not in the [1,31] range. Test each version with at least one invalid date (e.g.,2004,13,-5).
